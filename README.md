## Description

Vinyl Vault is a full-stack MERN application that allows music enthusiasts to catalog and manage their vinyl record collections. Users can create an account, add albums to their personal vault, edit album details, and delete records from their collection. The app features JWT-based authentication and authorization to ensure each user's collection remains private and secure.

### Why I Built This

As a vinyl collector myself, I wanted to create a digital catalog to keep track of my growing collection. This app helps users organize their albums, remember what they own, and avoid purchasing duplicates.
